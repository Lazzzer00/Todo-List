# Todo-List
This is my first React project. It is a todo list.

There is the src folder. 
Inside we have the main.jsx, which renders the app.jsx. 
The app is divided into the newTodoForm and TodoList.

Using 
```tsx
{ UseState }
```
we render the inputs, checking and deleting. 

The TodoList is made up of the import from ListItems.
If there anything you would wanna change let me know!
