# Todo-List
This is my first React project. It is a short todo list that renders itself on every input.
There is the src folder. 
Inside we have the main.jsx, which renders the app.jsx. 
The app is divided into the newTodoForm and TodoList.
Using { UseState } we render the inputs, checking and deleting. 
The TodoList is made up of the import from ListItems.
If there anything you would wanna change let me know.
